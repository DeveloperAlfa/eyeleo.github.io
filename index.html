<p>Eye strain or asthenopia is a real problem for those who sit at a computer. It is caused by decreased blinking while working long hours focusing on computer screens. EyeLeo reminds to take breaks regularly, shows you simple eye excercises and prevents you from using the computer at break times. Following EyeLeo's regulations will result in less physical fatigue.</p>

<p>EyeLeo - is a PC application that stays in the  background and regularly reminds you to take breaks for your eyes and body in general. It has two sorts of breaks: short breaks with simple eye exercises every 5-10 minutes (depending on your preferences) and long breaks blocking the whole screen every hour or so. During long breaks, you're supposed to leave your workplace for a few minutes to move your body or have a snack.</p>

<p>EyeLeo was designed by engineers who had been using different analogues for quite a while but were not satisfied with them. We took into consideration their flaws and made a well-thought-out product. And it's absolutely free.</p>
