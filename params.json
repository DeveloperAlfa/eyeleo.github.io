It is caused by decreased blinking while working long hours focusing on computer screens. EyeLeo reminds to take breaks regularly, shows you simple eye excercises and prevents you from using the computer at break times. Following EyeLeo's regulations will result in less physical fatigue.\r\n\r\n### Everyone who spends more than an hour per day looking at a display needs to work on it.\r\nEyeLeo - is a PC application that stays in the  background and regularly reminds you to take breaks for your eyes and body in general. It has two sorts of breaks: short breaks with simple eye exercises every 5-10 minutes (depending on your preferences) and long breaks blocking the whole screen every hour or so. During long breaks, you're supposed to leave your workplace for a few minutes to move your body or have a snack.\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out our [documentation](https://help.github.com/pages) or [contact support](https://github.com/contact) and we’ll help you sort it out.\r\n",
