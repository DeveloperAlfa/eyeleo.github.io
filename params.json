It is caused by decreased blinking while working long hours focusing on computer screens. EyeLeo reminds to take breaks regularly, shows you simple eye excercises and prevents you from using the computer at break times. Following EyeLeo's regulations will result in less physical fatigue.\r\n\r\n### Everyone who spends more than an hour per day looking at a display needs to work on it.\r\nEyeLeo - is a PC application that stays in the  background and regularly reminds you to take breaks for your eyes and body in general. It has two sorts of breaks: short breaks with simple eye exercises every 5-10 minutes (depending on your preferences) and long breaks blocking the whole screen every hour or so. During long breaks, you're supposed to leave your workplace for a few minutes to move your body or have a snack.\r\n\r\n### Features:\r\nScreen blocking long breaks every hour.\r\nShort breaks with eye exercises in every 10 minutes.\r\nEye exercises shown by an adorable Leopard.\r\nNotifications announcing a long break coming.\r\nA Strict mode that does not allow skipping the breaks.\r\nCustomizable parameters.\r\nMulti-monitor system support.\r\n\r\n\r\n###Why is it better than others?\r\nEyeLeo was designed by engineers who had been using different analogues for quite a while but were not satisfied with them. We took into consideration their flaws and made a well-thought-out product. And it's absolutely free.\r\n\r\n###Feedback\r\nYour opinion is very important for the project.\r\nIf you have any ideas or suggestions how to improve EyeLeo, please feel free to share:\r\n1. Send a private feedback message.\r\n2. Write at eyeleoapp@gmail.com.\r\n3. Leave a public comment.\r\n!(http://eyeleo.com/images/logo.png)\r\n",
